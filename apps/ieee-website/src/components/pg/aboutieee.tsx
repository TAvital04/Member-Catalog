							Additionally, IEEE @ UCF members have the opportunity to lead and
							participate in a variety of club-funded engineering projects – including
							the Internal Project Competition, Micromouse, and Guitar Hero. These
							projects enable members to apply their skills in real-world,
							collaborative environments while making impactful additions to their
